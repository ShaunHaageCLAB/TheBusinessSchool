<h3>Intro to The Business School</h3>

<p>The Business School at Varsity College offers ambitious working adults the opportunity to build on their skills with convenient part-time study. You can choose from a variety of world class programmes, that won’t impact on your work hours.</p>

<p>Many of our lecturers maintain full time jobs in between lecturing at The Business School. The subjects they teach are also usually what they do for a living. So, they are able to provide real-world experience first-hand. This is in line with The Business School’s approach to adult learning, which utilises both theory and practical application.</p>

<p>Our aim is to provide a vibrant, fulfilling experience for students. And to ensure their return to a formal learning environment is as undaunting as possible.</p>

<p>We offer a high standard of education, with high quality educators and hand-picked partners.</p>

<p>For more information on available programmes, please contact any one of our campuses.</p>

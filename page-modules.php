                        <p>It is easier to answer this question by pointing out what a short learning programme/ short course is not. In South Africa any programme of learning that is provided for on one of the qualifications frameworks and\or is at least 120 credits of study needs to be accredited and registered as a qualification. Where it is accredited depends on the level. All other courses of study are short learning programmes\short courses. Generally speaking if the study is going to take at least a year it would not be a short course.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of a short learning programme is to provide – usually working – adults with new or upgraded knowledge or skill in one particular area. The aim is to immediately improve or update the ability of the person to carry out a particular task or specialist skill.</p> 
                        <p>Some short courses are of a recreational focus (such as elements of digital photography) and are aimed at developing skills that are for personal development reasons, rather than related to career progression.</p>
                        <p>Frequently – particularly after graduation from a full qualification – a short learning programme is a quick and efficient way to get the skills you need to improve your workplace performance, using up to date theory and methods.</p>
